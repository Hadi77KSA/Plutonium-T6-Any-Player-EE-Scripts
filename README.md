## Die Rise

### Elevators Step and Dragon Puzzle
Require the same amount as the number of players. If the Dragon Puzzle step is failed, it will reset back to require the same amount as the number of players.

### Trample Steam step:
#### Maxis Side
- On solo and on 3p while the 1st ball is already flinging between Trample Steams placed on a set lion symbols, only one Trample Steam will be required in order to be able to place down a ball.
- If the number of players is 2 or less, the players will have the ability to place both balls on the same set of Trample Steams.
- On 3p, having the 1st ball flinging is required to be able to place the other ball on the lone Trample Steam.

#### Richtofen Side
Requires the players to place Trample Steams only on the same amount of symbols as players.

## Buried
### Maxis Side
Only works for less than 3p.
#### Wisp Step
Wisp no longer relies on zombies getting near it.

#### Bells Step
Removed time limit. Only resets if it's failed.

### Richtofen Side
#### Round Infinity A.K.A the Time Bomb Step

## Super Easter Egg
Allows for the Super Easter Egg button to be accessible with any number of players as long as: the players have, collectively, inserted the Navcards on all three Victis maps of TranZit, Die Rise, and Buried; and each player in the lobby has completed the Victis maps' Easter Eggs on the same side across the maps; and the completed side across all players is the same.
